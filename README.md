#Code Quiz Game

## Project Overview

This project was created in order to give coding bootcamp students the opportunity to take a timed quiz on Coding fundamentals and be able to store their high scores.  The user has 60 seconds to answer 5 questions, for each incorrect answer 10 seconds is taken off of the timer.

## Getting Started

From the Home page the user selects "Play Game" to enter the quiz.

After Selecting "Play Game," the user will then be asked a series of 5 multiple choice questions, all to be answered within 60 seconds.

If the user gets a question wrong, the time is shortened by 10 seconds, and then loads the next question.

When the quiz is finished, the user is presented with the option to save their score, replay the game, or go to the home page.  Saving the score is then saved onto local storage and generated into the high scores list if it qualifies.  The final score saved in high scores is the amount of time the user took to complete the quiz pluse the points they acquired.

The top 3 high user scores are saved and put into a list on the High Scores page.

## Project Challenges

I found this project particularly challenging because a lot of the criteria was structured into HTML but modified using JavaScript.  Other challenges included learning how to store criteria into local storage and calling functions.
